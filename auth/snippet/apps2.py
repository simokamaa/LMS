To implement this, you can create a model for the vertical menu and link it to the app creation process. Then, based on the user's role/group, the sidebar menu will dynamically display the apps. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create Model for Vertical Menu**: Define a model to represent the vertical menu structure. This model will store the menu items.

2. **Link App Creation to Vertical Menu**: When creating an app, suggest one based on the vertical menu model.

3. **Dynamic Sidebar Menu**: Render the sidebar menu dynamically based on the user's role/group.

Let's see an example implementation:

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class VerticalMenu(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    icon = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=100)
    group = models.ForeignKey('auth.Group', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group
from .models import VerticalMenu, App

@login_required
def initial_app_creation(request):
    if not App.objects.exists():
        # Only execute if no apps exist
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            # Suggest an app based on the vertical menu
            suggested_app = VerticalMenu.objects.first()
            if suggested_app:
                app = App.objects.create(
                    name=suggested_app.name,
                    icon=suggested_app.icon,
                    slug=suggested_app.slug
                )
                app.group.add(suggested_app.group)
            return redirect('sidebar')
    return redirect('home')  # Redirect to home page if apps already exist or user is not superuser

@login_required
def sidebar(request):
    user_groups = request.user.groups.all()
    user_apps = App.objects.filter(group__in=user_groups)
    return render(request, 'sidebar.html', {'user_apps': user_apps})

# sidebar.html
<ul>
  {% for app in user_apps %}
    <li>{{ app.name }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

In this implementation:

- The `VerticalMenu` model represents the structure of the vertical menu, with a name, icon, slug, and a group field linking to the Django `Group` model.
- In the `initial_app_creation` view, the first menu item from `VerticalMenu` is suggested when creating the initial app. This assumes that the first menu item will be suggested, you can adjust this logic based on your requirements.
- The suggested app is then created and linked to the group from the vertical menu item.
- In the `sidebar` view, apps are filtered based on the user's groups, and only the apps associated with the user's groups are rendered in the sidebar.

This way, the sidebar menu dynamically displays apps based on the user's role/group, and when initially creating an app, it's suggested based on the vertical menu model. Adjustments can be made according to your specific requirements and the structure of your vertical menu.

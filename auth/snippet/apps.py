Got it, you want to create a mechanism where when a superuser logs in for the first time, they are prompted to create a new app. Once the app is created, the menu structure from `vertical_menu.json` will be used to create apps, and these apps will appear in the sidebar based on the group permissions. Here's how you can approach this:

1. **Create Initial App Creation View**: Create a view to handle the creation of the initial app when the superuser logs in for the first time.

2. **Load Menu Structure**: Load the menu structure from `vertical_menu.json` into your Django models. This could be done using Django management commands or directly in the view.

3. **Create Apps from Menu Structure**: Use the menu structure to create apps in your Django models.

4. **Update Sidebar Template**: Update the sidebar template to dynamically render the apps based on the user's group permissions.

Here's a basic outline of how you can implement this:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group
import json
from .models import App

@login_required
def initial_app_creation(request):
    if not App.objects.exists():
        # Only execute if no apps exist
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            # Load menu structure from JSON
            with open('vertical_menu.json') as menu_file:
                menu_data = json.load(menu_file)

            # Create app based on menu structure
            # Assuming the menu_data is a list of dictionaries containing app information
            for app_data in menu_data:
                app = App.objects.create(
                    name=app_data['name'],
                    icon=app_data.get('icon', ''),
                    slug=app_data['slug']
                )
                # Assign group permissions to the app based on the 'group' field in the menu data
                group_name = app_data.get('group')
                if group_name:
                    group, _ = Group.objects.get_or_create(name=group_name)
                    app.group.add(group)
            return redirect('sidebar')
    return redirect('home')  # Redirect to home page if apps already exist or user is not superuser

@login_required
def sidebar(request):
    user_groups = request.user.groups.all()
    user_apps = App.objects.filter(group__in=user_groups)
    return render(request, 'sidebar.html', {'user_apps': user_apps})
```

In this example, `initial_app_creation` view checks if any apps exist in the system. If no apps exist and the logged-in user is a superuser, it loads the menu structure from `vertical_menu.json`, creates apps based on this structure, and assigns group permissions to them. After creating the apps, it redirects to the sidebar view.

The `sidebar` view fetches the apps based on the user's group permissions and renders them dynamically in the sidebar template.

You'll need to adjust the code according to your specific requirements, especially regarding how the menu structure is represented in `vertical_menu.json` and how the app creation logic should work. Additionally, make sure to handle errors and edge cases appropriately.
